## Our group meets together once to twice a week and does all the coding together. Typically we have Thomas, who focuses on the idea creation, give us ideas on how each part should work while the rest of us meet together and build the code together on Aidan's laptop and submit from there.

## With Thomas gone, we plan to change projects to a Blockly code that helps people build apps. Aidan and Tony have taken IOS classes so they will focus on the idea creating of how each block will work and Jordan will focus on designing a new interface that will make it easier to build with the blocks, while we all work together on making the code for the Blocks/Interface.

## We use AI to catch any mistakes we make in our code that we can not figure out on our own.
