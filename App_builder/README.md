Motivation and Description: The motivation for this project is that there are a lot of apps being created nowadays but it isn't very easy and not many people understand not only how to build them but also how to use the language Swift. On top of that, it can be hard to get started on a new project. This project will help developers and new developers easily get started on projects as well as learn about how the Swift language works.

To start the program, click this link:
[App Builder](https://AidanFLG.github.io/App_builder/)

After creating something in the blockly code, you can download it using the "download swift" button to download a file named 'generated.swift' with all the code you have generated. With this file, you can copy it into a new Xcode project and your application will be created.

Relation to Parsing, Interpretation, and Compilation:

Parsing in the App Builder Project:
In the context of our App Builder Blockly project, parsing is analogous to the process by which the system reads and understands the sequence of code set by the user. Just as a computer parser reads and checks the syntax of a code to ensure it is structured correctly, the app project parses the input code sequence to ensure it's a valid representation of swift information. For instance, the system would ensure that only the correct inputs in each variable are used in an appropriate correlation with the blocks surrounding it. This step is vital as it sets the foundation for subsequent processes, ensuring that only accurate blockly code is used for replication, transcription, and translation into swift code that will later be used in an application like Xcode.

Interpretation in the DNA Project: 
In this project, interpretation can be compared to the transcription and translation processes of blockly code to swift code. In programming, interpretation involves reading the source code line by line and executing it directly without prior conversion to another form. Similarly, in the project, the 'interpretation' phase reads the blockly sequence, transcribes it to Swift code, and then translates it into a page that is readable by a different system that has a better understanding of Swift. This is a dynamic process where the blockly 'instructions' are read and directly transformed into a functional outcome, much like how an interpreter handles code. 

Compilation in the DNA Project: 
Compilation in computer science refers to converting source code into machine code. In our App project, the act of code replication embodies this concept. The original Blockly sequence is compiled into a new, complementary Swift code strand. This replication ensures that the Swift style of instructions is preserved and can be passed on.
