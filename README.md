we have been dealing with problems within the group so we now have two different sets of code. The DNA project which is the one we originally started, and the app development project. The DNA project includes all members while the app project doesn't include Thomas Kim

DNA replication embodies this concept. The original DNA sequence is compiled into a new, complementary DNA strand. This replication ensures that the genetic instructions are preserved and can be passed on.
