## Our group meets together once to twice a week and all code together and/or split up coding so we can multitask on different blocks/files.

## Aidan and Tony have taken IOS classes so they will focus on the idea creating of how each block will work and Jordan will focus on designing a new interface that will make it easier to build with the blocks, while we all work together on making the code for the Blocks/Interface.

## We use AI to catch any mistakes we make in our code that we can not figure out on our own.
