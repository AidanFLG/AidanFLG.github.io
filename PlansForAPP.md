# Here are our current plans for the app!

## What we currently have:

### We currently have a basic set up for our app.

#### We have user library on 

## What we plan on adding:

### 

## What a future developer could add to make it better:

### creating two different modes. One for experienced users to have free rain over all blocks, And another mode for inexperienced users.

#### The application already basically has the experienced mode, but for the inexperienced mode, you would have to add a secondary button to the main page that allows a user to pick between what kind of a user they are. For this secondary more, the user will only have access to limited blocks at a time as to give them only options that would work with what blocks they already have. also for this mode, it will give the user a helper description about what each block does when hovered over by the user's mouse or when the user clicks on said block(and/or create an area where the user can drag the block to the right side to display its description). It will also give the user different ways of using the block.
